# AI Tax Agent App

## Introduction

---

An AI-driven chatbot to assist citizens with tax inquiries, provide accurate information from a knowledge base, and facilitate appointment bookings for audits and inquiries efficiently.

## How to Run the Program Locally

To set up and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install the required dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Obtain an API key from GrokAI and add it to the `.env` file in the project directory.

```commandline
GROK_API_KEY=your_secrit_api_key
```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

Once completed, the app will open in your default web browser. If it doesn't, check the terminal for the link (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
